**üå∂Ô∏è Chili and Cilantro üåø - A Spicy Bluffing Game**

**Welcome, Aspiring Chefs!**
Prepare your palate for a culinary journey filled with fresh cilantro and an unexpected kick of chili! Your mission: Create the perfect dish by adding just the right amount of cilantro without ruining it with a scorching chili. Be cautious yet daring, for the path to becoming a Master Chef is not without its spicy challenges!

**Objective:**
Your goal is to successfully season your dish by turning over a specified number of cilantro cards without getting a fiery surprise from the chili. Be the first chef to craft two perfectly seasoned dishes or be the last chef standing to win!

**Components:**
- **Cilantro Cards** (Green): Your desired ingredient, safe and flavorful.
- **Chili Cards** (Red): A potential culinary disaster, spicy and dangerous.

**Setup:**
1. Each chef receives a set of four cards: 3 Cilantro and 1 Chili.
2. Determine the first chef - perhaps the last person who cooked a meal!

**Gameplay:**
1. **Seasoning Round**: Chefs take turns placing one card face-down, starting with the first chef and going clockwise.
   
2. **The Bid**: Once each chef has placed a card, starting from the first chef, decide: Bid or Pass. Bidding indicates how many cilantro cards you believe you can flip over without uncovering a chili. Each bid must be higher than the previous.

3. **The Tasting**: If you placed the highest bid, your tasting begins! Start flipping your own cards first. If you meet your bid without flipping a chili, your dish is a success!
   
4. **Winning a Round**: Craft a splendid dish without the overpowering chili, and you're one step closer to victory. Mark your progress with a token or a different colored card.
   
5. **Burning the Dish**: If you uncover a chili, your dish is scorched! You must remove one card from your set (of your opponent's choosing) for the remainder of the game.

**Ending the Game:**
- Be the first to successfully season two dishes without burning, or;
- Be the last chef standing after all others have lost their cards.
   
**Extra Spice:**
- Play with variant rules to add extra flavor! Perhaps some rounds require multiple chilies, or perhaps some cilantro cards are extra potent (counting for two)!
   
**Bon App√©tit!**
Embrace the thrill of the culinary world, navigating through the careful balance of spice and flavor. May your dishes be ever flavorful, and may you avoid the dreaded chili burn. Happy cooking, chefs, and may the best palate win!
